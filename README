This project is just an ATTiny84 programmed to:

* Produce random voltages (after low-pass) on a pin using PWM.
* Blink some lights.
* Play a short melody with squarewave on a pin every once in a while.

It was made for a box with a galvanometer, a pair of big red/green lights, and a speaker. It's not intended to do anything more usefull.
